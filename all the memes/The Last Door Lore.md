She also wrote but couldn't send a letter to her friend Margaret, saying that she is hopeless without the company of caretakers. The doctor also won't help her because of his quarrel with Anthony. It seems that everyone hates him. He and Anna also had a child, a daughter.

   Baldwin claims to have never met Monsignor despite being employed by him. 
- Jeremiah meets Mother Elizabeth. She claims they only ran the building after the school was closed with the exception of Monsignor. She tepidly acquiesces to Jeremiah's request to look around the nursing home.
   She claims that a lot of the patients are recently dying because of god's will.
- Miss Mary Vinge, and her bro, Matthew Vinge. Matthew has lost contact with his fiancee Juliet and has gone unstable. However, Juliet Holloway has sent a letter to the nursing home wanting to reach Matthew, revealing that her brothers are controlling her relationship with him and are deceiving and gaslighting her. Double twist, Mary is also hiding multiple of these letters from him and pretending that it's just their mother sending them regards.

- Flashback: Anthony wants to host a secret meeting with the four witnesses. However, Glynn/Ernest/Monsignor is spying on them. He invites him too, and so four witnesses and Ernest saw beyond the veil.
- Father Ernest self immolates. He claims he lived his life to worship the 'Eye of the Bird', a vision resulting from the experiment, he killed many people trying to replicate it's results. The four Witnesses are those that saw the Eye. Then, his servant Baldwin attempts to KILL Jeremiah by burying him alive.

### Episode 3 - The four Witnesses
 Late December 1891 - London, England
- Somebody saves Jeremiah by digging up his coffin, moving it inside a basement all the way to London Old Nichol Street Rookery and unlocking for Jeremiah to escape in a dehydrated and injured condition. The town is in deep poverty, the salesmen are very rude.
- In a flashback of Jeremiah walking through the storming cold, we get a flashback. Of Jeremiah's dad telling him his mother will die of decease, Jeremiah seems to be in middle school at the time. His dad is telling him that he will abandon him because he has too many responsibilities and too little time. And so he sent him to Scotland, at the Boarding school telling him to never write letters because he cba. At the school his dad never sent a letter. Devitt was a lonely and odd kid. Anthony introduced him to his other two friends in a warm welcome.
- Jeremiah sees a strange ginger dude who seems familiar, the ginger guy walks away. Ginger dude leads him to a house, in the house Jeremiah sees a familiar face in a portrait.
- Some guy in red clothing (Dr. Kaufmann) tells Dr. Wakefield that Jeremiah, who has been missing for 3 weeks, is in some shit, and that this should be kept secret.
- Jeremiah finds a woman in her 50s who is scarred and was abused by her father who forced and made her a successful dancer. She may have wanted to kill her father. She is called Daphne and is actually dead. Jeremiah meets a violin player, (who might be her dad), who worked with her, he still mourns her. He gives Jeremiah a key and a violin and tells him to see Simurg, he says Simurg is what the crows are searching for (Simurg is a legend, the king of birds).
- Daphne's coffin is broken and shattered by someone. There's a hole in the wall, Jeremiah sees a creepy Eye through a keyhole and is invited to enter a dark bookshop. There, some weird dude is "reading in pitch darkness". He has a talk with Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah goes through the fog following the ginger man and the poem he found from Daphne's grave (also mentioned Zha'ilathal). The man finally talks and asks for the ticket that was given to Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah enters the stage of a theater, he finds Alexandre, the third witness. Alexandre tells him that "The Bird", protected Devitt and saved his life. That ever since the incident of the boarding school, it's been scheduled that they shall meet again some day. And that it doesn't only protect the four witnesses but more people involved. He refers to the bird as a "He", "His influence and power is ever-expanding". He unveils the curtain, Jeremiah can see about 10 masked people making gestures standing. Alexandre gives him the mask and welcomes him.
- Philosophy, religion, science were the studies of the four witnesses.
- Johan Kaufmann sends Dr. Wakefield a letter telling him to meet at the rendezvous. Also warning him that Jeremiah is in some shit that he did not anticipate and desperately will need their help. 
### Episode 4 - Ancient shadows
Late December 1891 - Eastbourne, South England
- "You must find the door that gives passage through the Veil." - Alexandre to Devitt.
- Dr. Wakefield talks to Kaufmann in a train ride, Kaufmann asks him about the "Massacre of Saint Gall". He claims that Devitt is one of the victims of that massacre. He refers to Alexandre as "the criminal", and that he tried the same exact method with Devitt as he has with all his victims. Apparently Devitt was being earthed in a coffin, and the nuns saved him and hospitalized him, he was unconscious for a whole day. Kaufmann was after Devitt during episode 2, but couldn't reach Aberdeen in time, he lost Devitt's traces there. Devitt was found in the coffin with a needle filled with a mysterious substance, that probably also explains the crazy shit he feels/sees.
- Jeremiah enters Alexandre's house. He sees portraits of him and (probably) his wife. He finds Alexandre upstairs, being unresponsive in a trance. He finds a note on (Alexandre's?) bed. The note refers to the curtains of The Veil as "Zha'ilathal" and again, it's a worship to the bird beyond the curtains and what it entails. "Inside its ancient mist, inhabit the shadows of those who left." He also finds an empty box of Laudanum, a mixture of opium and alchohol anti-anxiety drug, this could have been injected into Alexandre or Devitt or both.
- Jeremiah finds a note of August 1887, written by some worker of Alexandre. He talks about some creepy bird sculptures in his basement, he moves them inside the greenhouse so that they will mold. Also a portrait of an old man, a ship captain. A portrait of a couple wearing rat masks at a festival. He finds a note of someone excited about their alchemy related chemical invention, which was made happen by their university, [from: A witness (use of "Videte ne quis sciat"), to: Alexandre]. A diary page from October 1887, from the same or another worker of Alexandre's household, talking about "mr. Du Pre"'s condition of permanent stupor (later revealed Du Pre is Alex's last name).
- After doing chemical and bloody lightbulb memes, Devitt sees an encrypted photograph of Anthony, Alexandre and a third person that is blurred out. Jeremiah shows this to Alexandre and he goes psycho mode, breathing like a maniac and repeating "The Bird awaits.". After enabling the bird cuckoo, he starts having a seizure full of horror, repeating "Zha'ilathal".
- Jeremiah finds a note in Alexandre's basement. In the note the writer makes the claim that they made a serum in the Boarding school and that it was no other but the function to seeing past the curtain.
- Jeremiah digs up the grave of "Old Mike", a small ape. It held a map of constellations revealing "The Summer Triangle". And a note, written by the same witness that had the alchemy epiphany. He talks to Alexandre as a rival, "Your methods are stronger than mine". He says that Raymundus Lully sought the same thing as them and that he had found a chemical formula "hoopoe" which was very similar to the serum they invented at the boarding school.
- Alexandre screams on top of his lungs and dissappears. Jeremiah finds a diary page of his in 10/31/1891, talking about how he's going crazy and missing sleep but still fantasizes about his utopia. He says that he saw "the professor" on his balcony and was filled with joy but then he heard a really loud snore of Alexandre and he now wants to leave this house (yes, this doesn't make sense). A crow sits besides Jeremiah and says: "NEVERMORE" slowly. Jeremiah goes to the basement and hears a man speaking gibberish.
- Jeremiah finds a hidden room in the basement and a note: August 1887 The witness has now managed to get the serum to work thanks to Alexandre's encrypted formula. The serum was used on a person and they "rapidly entered a state of waking sleep" until the convulsions stopped and didn't respond to any kind of stimulation afterwards. The subject went braindead for days. Ends with "Which should be the next step, Alexandre? I'm worried this will be the end of our research. Videte ne quis sciat.". 
- The sculptures of the basement have all been moved to block Jeremiah's path, either illusions or real.
- Jeremiah unlocks a cabinet and finds one Syringe, with another one missing. After he takes the empty hypodermic needle, he hears the same gibberish coming from a long black hole in the room. He climbs down the hole and finds Alexandre moving around again. He asks Alexandre: "This is what you asked me to search for?" Alexandre responds: "The Last Door... Zha'ilathal...". Jeremiah wants to cross the last door with Alexandre and asks him for what he should do. Alexandre is waiting for the mist, the beating of the wings. Jeremiah acquiesces and sits down the chair, gives him the syringe, which is filled with chemicals. Alexandre injects Jeremiah and hallucinations happen.
- Kaufmann and Wakefield go to Sussex in A.Beechworth to find clues for Devitt's dissappearance, the police had raided the place. But never found a secret note written by Anthony to Alexandre that was never sent out. Anthony begs Alexandre to NEVER open the door, because if it opens, it will stay open for anyone to enter, which will probably lead to calamity.

Note: I think Jeremiah supports Alexandre because he thinks that he is the one that saved his life from Baldwin. 


### Season 1 Extras
The morgue:
Playing as some dude that is making a medical report on Ernest's corpse. Wonders about his death, he opens Ernest's stomach to see if he was drugged, finds a note with a drawn eye and the names: Ernest Glynn, Jeremiah Devitt, Alexandre Du Pre and Hugo Ash****, which is also crossed out. 

Death Sentence: 
Francis Baldwin. Sentenced to death for 14 murders of sick and innocent people. Hanged. Baldwin is probably a necrophilic and doubled down on his pride before his death, saying he freed the victims from suffering.

Wanderer in the Fog:
1 Woman, Ms. Pernell survived the Nursing home memes. Kaufmann (who is also a doctor) talks to her to find clues. She was also buried alive and opened the coffin. Found a woman who was not responding to her, just walking away inside the fog in the streets of Aberdeen. She met a priest, a novelist and a boy. The novelist was the tarot woman of episode 3, she had a card of a red veiled man holding a lamp and gave it to her, she gave it to Kaufmann. Her story might be a delusion.

Beechworth's Wake:
Anthony sees his father dying, a perhaps terrible man who traveled the world and abandoned his family determined to do something not understood by anyone. Hated by them, he left all his belongings to Anthony. He also left Anthony a book of all his research on "finding the other side" and warns him to use all that knowledge wisely. This burden probably affected Anthony's mental state.

### Episode 1 - The Playwright
Late 1892 - East Hill London, England
- Kaufmann gives orders to Wakefield to go to East Hill Lunatic Asylum because of the note in the Beechworth mansion, they were in pursuit of Alexandre, who was likely institutionalized at that Asylum for years. Wakefield's objective is to confirm this and gather intel on Du Pre.

- Mr. Roan had acute dementia, was crazy, they injected him with morphine, doubled the dosage to no effect, he bit a doctor in the face and had self harm scars on him. He gradually became way better in October 1891 however and became gradually more religious, in a language not understood by anyone.
- Paperboy says that the asylum was surprisingly silent one night, but then a massive scream happened. Paper says: Sea monster found in St. Ives its remains were found on the beach.

Skidd tells Wakefield that Alexandre is involved in a conspiracy group called "The Playwright", a secret society of mass control and power led by Alexandre, Skidd was once a member of it. He's been hiding from them since he was involved with the group and it has ruined his life.
- Wakefield passes out imagining weird shit similar to what Devitt saw. He wakes up in some room he's never seen before and sees Devitt taunting him. He then wakes up next to Kaufmann, who tells him he was found in the ward of the Asylum, smelling like opium. Apparently Ms. Konhe was or is a member of the Playwright, Kaufmann and Wakefield pursue her in her hideout, which is somehow known by Kaufmann, all because she somehow escaped the asylum. They fail because she does some bullshit ritual in time and turns into ashes.

### Episode 2 - My Dearest Visitor
January 20th 1893 - Wickport, England
- Kaufmann tells Wakefield that it's some supernatural shit that the occult is involved with, and in order to gather intel he recommends that they see his own mentor, Professor Adam Wright at Wickport (an infamous haunted town).
- At the Wright manor they meet Ms. Oakwood, the manor's housekeeper. Unlike their expectations, the Professor is suffering from a brain ailment and is confined to his bed 24/7. He suffers severe memory loss that is apparently inherented from his fucked family tree. 
- After opening a concealed envelop that links to some kind of "visitor" Kaufmann doubts his mentor and wonders if he is intentionally hiding something from them and partly pretending or having gaslit himself into forgetting all this shit.
- After solving a long riddle and opening a secret room inside the wall, Kaufman and Wakefield find a note of "Experiments, 1885". Mr. Wright was documenting a beast that strolled around the underground tunnels. He installed devices and wants to use the beast to his advantage. After months he abandoned his idea because the beast was out of his control, so he sealed the tunnel with the beast inside, hoping that noone reaches it again. 
- Kaufmann finds that Mr. Wright was involved with the Playwright, and had made deals with Alexandre. The tunnel device is used to listen to the beast from a distance. Wright states that Primal Terror drives people beyond "The Veil" of rational thought, and that it will be the key to opening The Last Door. Kaufmann also suspects that a lot of the documents have been hidden elsewhere, likely in the basement. He suggests that they should find Wright's device to get access to the sealed tunnel, so that they can read the hidden documents.
- After Wakefield enables the device, they hear a piano song playing from the tunnel, guessing that someone is down there playing the piano, Kaufmann predicts that the sealed tunnel has a second entrance that they haven't yet found. Wakefield wanting answers, practices hypnotism on Mr. Wright. And they get a rough map of how to get to the beast:
Default: Forest
	North: Waterfall, bottomless abyss
		East: Tunnel
			Oscar is here.
			North: Piano
				Beast.
		West: Edge of the forest

- They also hear a about a man named Oscar who was screaming at Mr. Wright not to proceed inside the tunnel. 
- The next morning, Kaufmann is badly sick and sends Wakefield to the town to gather intel on Oscar and where he can find him. An intelligent sick lady at the town tells him that Oscar is a priest at the local church, and that he is a hopeless and nervous man. 
- Wakefield finds a captain drinking called Fred Morvell, he tells Wakefield about a howling that would be heard when sailing near the coast. He then crashed and sunk his ship, from which he lot his "Augustine" he's been depressed ever since. Augustine ends up being a fucking bell.
- The town is forsaken and haunted by apparitions, most people are leaving and nobody has been going to the church.
- Wakefield meets Oscar, a theologian, who tells him that Wright was an anthropologist, and a close friend of his.
- Mr. Wright mysteriously ran away from his house, at some point he re-enters it, faints and dies in front of Wakefield in an expression of utmost terror.
- Wakefield goes to Kaufmann immediately only to find him passed out, some Dr. Armitage claims to have given him a sedative and that he is taking care of him. Kaufmann looks pale, weak and breathes heavily.
- Wakefield finds the summer house of Mr. Wright. Which holds the entrance to the tunnel. After digging up an artifact key, he enters the tunnel. He finds the remains of a dead person. Follows the melody of the piano, which abruptly stops as he approaches.

### Episode 3 - The Reunion
1894 - Ellis Mor, England
"Mr. Ashdown" -{Possible H.A.}
- Wakefield manages to run for his life, dives into the sea and almost drowns, he is found unconscious at the beach and saved.
- Kaufmann ensures to leave a last  note to Wakefield: "Lieber Wakefield, I write this letter in my last moments of lucidity. I have not received word from you since I regained consciousness, but I am confident that you will soon return with information that is crucial to our investigation. The bravery that you demonstrated in the face of these latest discoveries is worthy of my most sincere admiration. I must now ask you for yet more courage. The doctors were unable to determine the cause of my sudden illness, nor have they found a cure. I have not much time left. My greatest regret is that I must abandon you to the difficult tasks that lie ahead. I implore you to preserve, now that we are so close to finding an answer." ", mein Freund. I do not need to remind you to exercise the uttermost discretion. I have complete trust in you. Always your friend. Johan Kaufmann."
- In that same letter Kaufmann instructs Wakefield to go to the island of Ellis Mor because of Mr. Wright's multiple references to the dark legend of the island's sanctuary, Cronemeadan.
- Wakefield loses all his motivation to proceed with his mission of finding Devitt because of how hard his best friend's death hit him. After months of doubt, he mustered up the determination to investigate Ellis Mor, in honor of Kaufmann (And to an extent Devitt).
- Dr. Wakefield arrives at Ellis Mor, it seems that immediately some Lord Donnan knows about it and invites Wakefield for dinner, which is bad considering the Playwright might be keeping tabs on him. 
- Lord Donnan says that according to the village's tradition, the following three nights the spirits of the "Other Side" roam the hills of Eilis Mor. Also, a festival takes place in which they wear costumes with masks so that the spirits don't recognize their faces, and the people perform several rites. It's a tradition of the druids that they worship the god Lugh Lamhfhada, of which there is a statue in the room. An expert of the folklore is Ms. Foster. Lord Donnan claims to not take these traditions by word but kind of believes them because "why not?", which is fucking retarded.
- People are wearing fnaf furry masks and burying mirrors at the graveyard.
- Ms. Foster says to Wakefield that Lord Donan's kid has gone missing at some abandoned house, and that the Cronomeadan is the big bottomless pit found at the hill, it's said that at the end of the hole, there's "The Crooked One", a giant snake. And that it's afraid of iron, similarly to any beast from the Other Side.
- Wakefield visits the abandoned house in which the kid had disappeared. Outside the building he notices a wicker man statue. Upon exiting the house to go North, the wicker man is being burned, which he questions.
- A ton of wicker men statues start appearing at places they don't complement in an unsettling fashion.
- Wakefield smacks a fucking pipe with a rock to alert the lighthouse keeper of his presence.
- He fixes the lighthouse, with every wicked man being set on fire behind his back. Using the lighthouse's light, he discovers a secret door to the end of the bottomless pit. 
- Wakefield finds himself trapped by the villagers, he follows the underground area surrounded in mist until he sees Devitt.

### Episode 4 - Beyond the Curtain 
1894 - ?
- Alexandre wants to protect the Playwright from Wakefield, and so he announces that he must be stopped.
- Devitt leads Wakefield to some place, perhaps trying to persuade him into joining the Playwright.
- Wakefield walks through the fog, meets a lot of cultists, some person is locked in a cage. Then, a flashback happens of someone in their office (maybe H.A.? or A.B.?) talking about how they are sending Devitt to some long crazy journey. Anthony is responsible for a lot of deaths. He says he has to warn Devitt fast.
- We get a flashback of Alexandre talking to Hugo Ashdown aka H.A., the fourth witness. Hugo knows about Alexandre's plan to reach the Other side and Alexandre tries to convince him that it will work this time. Alexandre talks to Hugo about Wright helping them. Apparently Hugo had met Kaufmann. Though he says that Wright is close to Hugo's methods than Alexandre's. Alexandre suggests that they should get a certain person to surpass the threshold required (probably Devitt). Hugo finds a scarred person traumatized about his fingers being (cut?) (it's probably Devitt because of the chair incident of episode 4).
- Apparently the experiment at the school caused something to Ernest Glynn, and that is why the school close. Anthony's father had found that a lot of ancient myths were true behind the veil, but some being is protecting the Door, or threshold, from people entering. Anthony, through his serum, managed to get the 4-5 witnesses a glimpse of what is beyond the Veil. And says that according to his dad's writings, if the custodian discovers the intruders, he will pursue them until they die, with few ways of the intruders to protect themselves. Devitt recommends that they get Captain Skidd to lead them through the fog in order to evade the consequences of surpassing the threshold since he was already a survivor of an attack and kept a companion alive as well. So they begin another experiment with the entirety of the Playwright and a serum made by Mr. Wright. As a result of the experiment, Devitt passed out for a while and suffered memory loss. Alexander and Anthony are thankful that Devitt lost memories because he will be safe from the custodian, someone who wasn't safe from the custodian was Hugo. They plan to eventually guide Devitt back into the cult until they make the new and improved serum.
- Wakefield finds himself on the stage where all the experiments occur and speaks to Alexandre finally. Alexandre tells him that Devitt wanted to guide Wakefield in the Playwright, and that he was the original founder of it. He tells him that the Bird is a codename for the Custodian. Alexandre says that hugo tried and failed. At this point it's safe to assume that Hugo has been dead for a long time and in all the depictions of the four witnesses, Hugo is the one that is dead (also because of Ernest's note with H.A. crossed out.) and not Anthony. Anthony and Alexandre succeeded in the experiment without him even being alive. Alexandre did not anticipate either Anthony's or Ernest's madness and death. Though Alexandre discovered that Devitt has been plotting against the Playwright, and that he actually wants to acquire the First Language (aka what is beyond the Door) and use it to ruin Alexandre's plan.
- Devitt currently has crossed the Threshold and is trying to learn the Final Truth in order to destroy the Order, the door, and their work. 
 
 
### Ending
- Wakefield is given the choice to go beyond the veil and stop Devitt from ruining Alexandre's plan, he claims.

This leads the Player to two endings:
1)Devitt survives, Wakefield dies.
2)Wakefield survives, Devitt dies.

In both endings, the subject does the right thing to seal the door, though I will argue that sacrificing Devitt ensures it more because Wakefield has no prior experience. The survivor goes back home and makes a promise to themselves to never reveal any part of the conspiracy to anyone. With Devitt repeating "Videte ne quis sciat" and Wakefield reminiscing about Kaufmann's last wish.
